The light prop will render a video thumbnail with
 simple play icon, and only load the full player once a user 
has interacted with the image. Noembed is used to
 fetch thumbnails for a video URL. Note that automatic 
thumbnail fetching for Facebook, Wistia, Mixcloud
 and file URLs are not supported, and 
ongoing support for other URLs is not guaranteed.
If you want to pass in your own thumbnail to use,
 set light to the image URL rather than true.
The styles for the preview image and play icon 
can be overridden by targeting the CSS classes 
react-player__preview, 
react-player__shadow and react-player__play-icon.
